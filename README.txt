2 Notes:

1) Cheatcode is to name your ship "Fire Fly" which will set your stats absurdly high and allow you to go straight to the boss if you wish

2) Despite our best efforts we cannot figure out why anomaly.anome gets ocassionally corrupted. It is only used in two places, both cases it is opened and, pickled and immediately closed. If the game crashes on launch, running anomalyCreator.py will re-make the file.
